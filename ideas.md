Story:
=====
The temple could be like a tomb/vault where the gods locked away the knowledge of magic and alchemy in it, because they thought humans were yet too stupid and irresponsible to be trusted with such power, that's why they locked it in the temple and riddled it with traps and puzzles so only humans who are wise enough could find it. Eventually people found out about it and went in there, an expedition of archeologists/researchers. They were reckless though and activated a bunch of safeguards/traps which awakened guardians, enemies etc, which eventually killed them off. They also found a little bit of information about magic and alchemy though but couldn't fully understand it, tried to use it anyway, which resulted in them accidentally creating zombies and corrupting their fellow seekers of knowledge, which would be a good justification for putting enemies in the temple for the player to fight.
They never made it very far into the temple, eventually you reach a door they weren't able to open and that's where you continue where they left off.

The motivation for the Noita to go search for the temple comes from stories about the failed expedition they heard. It has been 100 years and most people either don't believe the story, or they they're too scared to go. So the Noita goes alone.

After wandering around the desert for what seems like an eternity, with their last water reserves they finally find the temple.

There are still the remains of the expedition scattered around the temple, whose last remains you can read through Psychometry, an ability you later find.
The story is told through their last thoughts.

At the end of the temple, you find out that the knowledge was stolen and there is a portal. However, the portal is unstable due to having been active for so long that it has lost most of it's magic. Stepping through it teleports you to the mountain where the main game begins, stripped of all items and memory due to the unstable nature of the portal.
